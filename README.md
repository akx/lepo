# Lepo â€“ Contract-first REST APIs in Django

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akx/lepo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/akx/lepo) [![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/akx/lepo.svg)]()

Lepo is a *contract-first* API framework that enables you to design your API using the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (formerly known as Swagger) and implement it in Python 3 and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

What does it mean when we say *contract-first*? Contrast this to *code-first*:

* **Code-first**: First write the implementation of your API endpoints. Interactive API documentation is generated from docstrings and other meta-data embedded in the implementation. The [Django REST Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) is a popular example of a framework that promotes code-first style.
* **Contract-first** (or **API first**): Write the *contract* of your API first in machine-readable documentation describing the available endpoints and their input and output. API calls are mapped into view functions using meta-data embedded in this machine-readable documentation. Other examples of contract-first frameworks include [connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) (using [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask)) and [Apigee 127](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) (using Node.js and Express).

## Documentation

Please see the [docs](./docs) folder for more extensive documentation.

## Why is it called *lepo*?

*Lepo* is Finnish for *rest*.
